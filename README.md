Comparison of Face and Skin Disease Detection: CNN vs. CNN-LSTM vs. Mobilenet

In the domain of identifying face skin diseases, encompassing categories like Acne, Actinic keratosis, Basal cell carcinoma, Lupus-Chronic-Cutaneous, Rosacea, Seborrheic dermatitis, and Squamous cell carcinoma, we explored different neural network architectures. Specifically, we employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the task and utilized one-hot encoding to classify each class within the range of 0-5. To evaluate model performance, we used a pre-trained Mobilenet architecture as a reference point.

The CNN model achieved an impressive training accuracy of 97% and a test accuracy of 82%. In contrast, Mobilenet Version - 2 exhibited a training accuracy of 93% and a test accuracy of 78%. Notably, the proposed CNN model outperformed the pre-trained Mobilenet model, highlighting its superiority in the realm of face skin disease detection."
